Single Cycle Processor for MIPS ISA able to process the following instructions (add, sub, slt, beq, j, lw, sw, and, or) as of 24th January, 2025.

Code is currently for simulation, the modules for FPGA configuration haven't been added yet
	- A file containing hexadecimal instructioons is included within the repo, 
  - The instructions form a sample program which writes the value 7 to address 84
	- Testbench reports if program executes successfully 
	
Next Steps(Long Term): Multicycle and Pipelined version
Next Steps(Short Term): Implement exception handling
